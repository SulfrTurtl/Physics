            <h2 class="subheading">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p class="text">
                One of the major goals of physics is to understand the nature of light. This goal has been difficult to achieve (and has not yet fully been achieved) because light is complicated. However, this complication means that light offers many opportunities for applications, and some of the richest opportunities involve the interference of light waves— <strong>optical interference</strong>. <br>
                <br>
                Nature has long used optical interference for coloring. For example, the wings of a Morpho butterfly are a dull, uninspiring brown, as can be seen on the bottom wing surface, but the brown is hidden on the top surface by an arresting blue due to the interference of light reflecting from that surface. <br>     <br>
                Moreover, the top surface is color-shifting; if you change your perspective or if the wing moves, the tint of the color changes. Similar color shifting is used in the inks on many currencies to thwart counterfeiters, whose copy machines can duplicate color from only one perspective and therefore cannot duplicate any shift in color caused by a change in perspective. <br>           
                <h3>Light as a Wave </h3>
                <p class="text">The first convincing wave theory for light was in 1678 by Dutch physicist Christian Huygens. Mathematically simpler than the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, it nicely explained reflection and refraction in terms of waves and gave physical meaning to the index of refraction. <br> <br>
                    Huygens’ wave theory is based on a geometrical construction that allows us to tell where a given wavefront will be at any time in the future if we know its present position. Huygens’ principle is: <br> <br>
                <strong>All points on a wavefront serve as point sources of spherical secondary wavelets. After a time t, the new position of the wavefront will be that of a surface tangent to these secondary wavelets. </strong>
